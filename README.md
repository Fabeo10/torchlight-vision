# torchlight-vision
A neat 2D dungeon crawler game with CV functionality implemented.

I use mac OS so all the commands will be mac/linux commands

Once you clone the repo be sure to install the requirements to your isolated environment with:
pip install -r requirements.txt

To run the game:
python3 -m app.main

Controls:
q = quit
w,a,s,d = move
m = toggle minimap
show hand = brighten area around you
show piece sign with hand = toggle between axe and bow
r = toggle recording for both cam and game capture screens
